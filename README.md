## Rails3 Stack Yammer Style
This is a sample application designed to loosely replicate what I know about the Yammer Rails3 Stack

This is primarily an excercise in developing flexible capistrano and chef scripts to support such a stack.

See the config/deploy.rb file

There is a lot I don't know about Yammer yet, this is just a starting point.
